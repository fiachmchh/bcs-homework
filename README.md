# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor Homework

Included are a html file and css file.

The main aim of this homework was to refactor existing code and make it more accessable.
The code was changed in the following manner with the view of achieving this:

- Changing the sizes of the logo, headings and fonts in general to make them standout more.
- Appropriate spacing bettween different sections of writing
- Slightly altering the contrast of letter colors in relation to their backgrounds.
- Underlining buttons which led to other parts of the page.
- Adding Margins to make the page standout.
- Moving the main column up, to the left and away from tabs that could be linked to from the bottom of the screen therefore making the layout less confusing.
- Images were made bigger
- Alt text added to images on the page 
- text alignment to the left
- fixing broken links on screen

Other aims achieved were:
- to make the html elements more semantic, 
- the application of a logical structure to html elements, 
- attaching alt attributes to images
- adding a descriptive title
- making sure heading attributes fell in sequential order

The CSS altered to make it less confusing, less repetitive for any future users.
